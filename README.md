### Project Goal

A commandline based tic-tac-toe game

### How to play

- Download the game from this [link](https://github.com/marcos-medeiros/tic-tac-toe/archive/master.zip)
- extract it and open commandline at the root of the extracted directory
- Type in `./bin/main.rb` to start the game.

#### Rules of the game

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Testing
go to the main folder and run 
```console
$ rspec
```

#### Assumptions
- That you have ruby installed
- That you are running on a unix based commandline tool
